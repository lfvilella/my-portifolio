    This project is really cool, I created it using Python Fastapi, Sqlalchemy, Vuejs and more. This is a
    little copy about <a href="https://www.serasa.com.br" target="_blank" style="color: #383838;">SERASA</a>,
    where people add debtors and every can see who is owing. That ideia to create
    this application was the UENP-CCT course.
